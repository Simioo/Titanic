# Titanic Survival Predictor

## Project Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a Titanic survival predictor. The goal of this project is to build a survival
predcition algorithm which takes the data of a certain passenger and predicts the survival chances for that person.
The information available for every passenger is: Name, Age, Gender, Class and information whether the passenger 
survived or not. With this limited amout of information compared to the full Titanic dataset available online, 
achieved accuracy was approximately 82% on the test set, which is reasonably good.

### Methods Used
* Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter
* Numpy
* Scikit-learn

## Project Description
Dataset is obtained from public Titanic dataset available online. Basic statistical analysis using jupyter notebook is
performed to determine the importance of features for predictions. After feature engineering and data pre-processing
based on inferences that are made in statistical analysis phase, we try to find best binary classifier. Few different
models are tested, with grid search for optimal hyper-parameters.

## Needs of this project

- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
